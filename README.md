# Line_Follower_Bot
A line follower bot is a type of autonomous robot designed to track and follow a specific path, typically a black line on a contrasting surface, using sensors such as infrared or color sensors. These robots are commonly used in applications such as industrial automation, educational projects, and hobbyist pursuits. By detecting the contrast between the line and its surroundings, the bot can adjust its movement to stay aligned with the path. Line follower bots are often used to demonstrate principles of robotics, sensor integration, and control systems in a fun and practical way.
